TASBE Flow Analytics package provides a user friendly, open-source environment to visually analyze flow cytometry data. 

INSTALLATION

 This project is intended to be run using either Matlab or Octave. A getting started document
to guide users through installation can be found <a href="https://github.com/mehersam/TASBEFlowAnalytics/blob/gh-pages/docs/tasbe-getting-started-tutorial.pdf">here</a>. 

WORKFLOW

 The recommended workflow for using the TASBE package is to process your data in three stages: 
   a.) Creation of a ColorModel which translates raw FCS data to comparable unit data. 
   b.) Using the created ColorModel for batch processing of experimental data 
   c.) Comparison and Plotting of the results of batch processing. 

Example files are provided that show how these stages typically work.
