TASBE Flow Analytics package provides a user friendly environment to analyze flow cytometry data.

INSTALLATION

 This project is intended to be run using either Matlab or Octave. A getting started document
to guide users through installation can be found here. 

WORKFLOW

In use of this package, you will typically want to split your
processing into three stages:

- Creation of a ColorModel that translates raw FCS to comparable unit data
- Using a ColorModel for batch processing of experimental data
- Comparison and plotting of the results of batch processing

Example files are provided that show how these stages typically work.
