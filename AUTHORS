History & Authorship of TASBE Flow Analytics:

The core functionalities of the TASBE Flow Analytics package was
originally created at BBN Technologies in 2010-2011 in support of the
"Tool-Chain to Accelerate Synthetic Biological Engineering"
project. It was then organized and systematized in 2012 and has been
improved contiuously ever since in response to evolving usage needs.

The main authors of the TASBE Flow Analytics package are:

  Jacob Beal, Aaron Adler, and Fusun Yaman.
